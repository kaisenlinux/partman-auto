_Description: Help on partitioning
 Partitioning a hard drive consists of dividing it to create the space
 needed to install your new system.  You need to choose which
 partition(s) will be used for the installation.
 .
 Select a free space to create partitions in it.
 .
 Select a device to remove all partitions in it and create a new empty
 partition table.
 .
 Select a partition to remove it or to specify how it should be used.
 At a bare minimum, you need one partition to contain the root of the
 file system (whose mount point is /).  Most people also feel that a
 separate swap partition is a necessity.  "Swap" is scratch space for an
 operating system, which allows the system to use disk storage as
 "virtual memory".
 .
 When the partition is already formatted you may choose to keep and
 use the existing data in the partition.  Partitions that will be used
 in this way are marked with "${KEEP}" in the main partitioning menu.
 .
 In general you will want to format the partition with a newly created
 file system.  NOTE: all data in the partition will be irreversibly
 deleted.  If you decide to format a partition that is already
 formatted, it will be marked with "${DESTROY}" in the main
 partitioning menu.  Otherwise it will be marked with "${FORMAT}".

 This probably happened because the selected disk or free space is too
 small to be automatically partitioned.

_Description: Partitioning method:
 The installer can guide you through partitioning a disk (using different
 standard schemes) or, if you prefer, you can do it manually. With guided
 partitioning you will still have a chance later to review and customise
 the results.
 .
 If you choose guided partitioning for an entire disk, you will next be
 asked which disk should be used.

 Cap RAM size to specified size in MB, when calculating the swap
 partition size. By default this is disabled, so swap size is not capped,
 while preseeding to a value of 1024 (with partman-auto/cap-ram=1024) for
 example results in swap partitions to be capped at 1GB.
