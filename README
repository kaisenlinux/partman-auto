This package adds to the main partitioning menu of partman an item
`Automatically partition the storage devices'.  For each free space
it also adds an item `Automatically partition this free space'.

For a description of the format and use of recipe files and other important
documentation, see debian-installer/doc/devel/partman-auto-recipe.txt

Note that for architecture-specific recipe files, partman-auto will look
in the following places for recipes:

/lib/partman/recipes-<arch>-<subarch>/*
/lib/partman/recipes-<arch>/*
/lib/partman/recipes/*

Partman-auto will use the recipes from the first of these directories
that exists.

Note: In order to compute similar sizes with and witout LVM, the sum
of (PRIORITY - MINIMUM) of lvmok partitions should be equal to 900.

The script build_recipes is not used to build the binary udeb package.
It allows to generate recipe files from a reduced set of values for the
following architectures: default, amd64, amd64/efi, armhf, arm64,
arm64/efi, ppc64el and risc64v.
See the comments at the beginning of the script for use and limitations.
